# 6DOF-robotic-arm

I designed a 6 degree of freedom robotic arm in Solidworks during the summer of 2021. I had the arm 3D printed with PLA from CraftCloud, and assembled the arm using
various bolts and nuts. Smooth aluminum shafts and GT2 timing pulleys are used for power transmission. The electronics for the project consist of an Arduino Mega 2560
paired with 6 A4988 stepper drivers, 6 Nema 17 Stepper motors, and one small servo motor for the gripper mechanism.
